    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does “Lounge Access” Actually Mean?</h2>
      <p>“Lounge access” is a broad label. In card documentation it can mean anything from a few visits per year in a third-party network to unlimited access to proprietary airline lounges when you fly on certain tickets.</p>
      <p>The underlying rights usually depend on a combination of factors: which lounge network is used, what type of card you hold, how many guest visits are allowed, and whether enrollment in a partner program is required before you can enter.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics / Access Models -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Common Lounge Access Models</h2>
      <p>Issuers and networks use different ways to attach lounge access to cards. Typical models include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Third-party lounge networks</strong> – access via global networks that your card partners with, often with a visit allowance per year.</li>
        <li><strong>Airline-branded lounges</strong> – access to a specific airline’s lounges, sometimes tied to same-day boarding passes on that carrier or alliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay-per-visit with discount</strong> – the card provides discounted entry, but you pay a fee for each visit.</li>
        <li><strong>Guest policies</strong> – some benefits include free guests, while others charge per additional guest or limit the number per visit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Benefit guides and partner terms are the primary sources for understanding which model applies to a given card and location.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Enrollment, Identification and Eligibility</h2>
      <p>Lounge access is not always “automatic”. Depending on the program, you may need to:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Enroll in a partner lounge program using your card details.</li>
        <li>Activate the benefit in your issuer’s app or online banking.</li>
        <li>Show a same-day boarding pass that meets specific rules.</li>
        <li>Present either the card, a digital membership ID, or both at the lounge desk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Documentation often includes an “enrollment required” note for lounge access, which is easy to miss if you only read short marketing summaries.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Blackout Rules and Changes Over Time</h2>
      <p>Lounge benefits can change. Typical limitations include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Visit caps</strong> – a fixed number of visits per year or per account.</li>
        <li><strong>Location restrictions</strong> – some lounges or airports may be excluded.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-of-day rules</strong> – access may be restricted when lounges are at capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Program changes</strong> – providers can alter their lounge partnerships, visit allowances or guest policies with notice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For that reason, benefit guides often recommend checking the latest partner list or app before relying on any specific lounge.</p>
